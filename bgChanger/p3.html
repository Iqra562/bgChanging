        Our solar system consists of our star, the Sun, and everything bound to it by gravity – the planets Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune; dwarf planets such as Pluto; dozens of moons; and millions of asteroids, comets, and meteoroids.<h1 >1: The solar System is 4.6 billion years old</h1>
        How old is the solar system? The solar system is 4.6 billion years old and 99.86% of its mass is contained in our Sun, a rotating yellow dwarf star whose powerful gravity causes numerous objects to revolve around it in nearly circular orbits, including the planets, moons, comets, asteroids, meteoroids, dust and gas.
        
        <h1> Sunlight takes around 8 minutes to reach Earth</h1>
        The Earth is located 93 million miles (150 million km) away from the Sun, a distance known to astronomers as an astronomical unit or AU. Traveling at the speed of light (186,282 miles per second), sunlight is able to cross this vast distance in around 8 minutes and 20 seconds.
        
        <h1>3: The Solar System is 2 light-years across</h1>
        How big is our solar system? The size of a solar system is determined by how far its sun’s gravity overpowers other objects in the region, which in the case of the Sun extends to the Oort Cloud, a reservoir of cometary material located between 5,000 and 50,000 AU away. That boundary would give the solar system a diameter of around 2 light-years across, or 12 trillion miles.
        
        <h1>4: Planets are made of rock or gas</h1>
        How many planets are in our solar system? There used to be nine solar system planets but since Pluto was downgraded to a dwarf planet in 2016 by the International Astronomical Union (IAU), that number has shrunk to just eight.
        
        The 8 planets of our solar system are divided into the inner planets of Mercury, Venus, Earth, and Mars, which are basically made of rock and metal; and the outer planets of Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune, which are made of hydrogen, helium and other gases. Despite being referred to as gas giants, intense heat and pressure towards their centers cause their gases to compress into liquid metal or rock.
        
        Unsurprisingly, ‘the Gas Giant’ Jupiter is the planet in our solar system with the most moons at 79 (53 confirmed). Meanwhile, Venus is the only planet to rotate about its axis in a clockwise direction.
        
       <h1> 5: Most asteroids are found between Mars and Jupiter</h1>
        Asteroids are usually rocky or metallic in nature and in our solar system most can be found orbiting the Sun between Mars and Jupiter in an area known as the asteroid belt (2.7 AU). It is believed that in the early evolution of the solar system, this region once contained enough material to form a planet but Jupiter’s intense gravity stopped the materials from successfully coalescing into a planet.
        
       <h1> 6: The closer to the Sun, the hotter the planet</h1>
        What is the hottest planet in our solar system? In general, the closer the planet is to the Sun the hotter is its average temperature. For example, the average temperature of Mercury, the planet nearest to the Sun, is a blistering +427 Celsius, while Neptune’s temperature is a chilly -200 Celsius. As well as being the furthest planet from the Sun, Neptune is also naturally the solar system’s coldest planet.
        
        Nevertheless, the story doesn’t end there. The planet Venus (460c) is actually hotter than Mercury thanks to its thick carbon dioxide atmosphere which creates a greenhouse effect. The planet Mercury, on the other hand, has a very thin atmosphere and so cannot trap the Sun’s heat very easily.
        
       <h1> 7: One year is different on each planet</h1>
        The closer the planet is to the Sun, the quicker is its annual orbit around our star. Whereas the Earth takes one year to revolve around the Sun, for instance, Mercury would complete its orbit in 88 days, while distant Neptune would complete its annual trek in 165 years.
        
        Top 10 Facts About The Solar System
        
       <h1> 8: The comets we see originate from within our solar system</h1>
        The comets we see in the night sky come from our solar system and are either short-period, in which case they originate in the Kuiper belt (30 To 50 AU), or longer-period comets, in which case they originate in the Oort cloud. Comets are made of ice and dust and as they approach the Sun their surfaces warm up causing their materials to vaporize, thus producing a comet’s characteristic tail. In the process, numerous meteoroids are shed and spread out along the orbit of the comet such that whenever the Earth’s atmosphere passes this dust trail a meteor shower occurs, such as the Geminids and Leonids.
        
       <h1> 9: The nearest star to Earth is Proxima Centauri</h1>
        Outside of our own solar system, the nearest star to Earth is a red dwarf star called Proxima Centauri (4.24 light-years), followed by Barnard’s Star in the constellation of Ophiuchus (6 light-years). The brightest star in the night sky, Sirius (-1.46 magnitude) in the constellation of Canis Major, is the 5th closest star to Earth at a distance of 8.6 light years.
        
        <h1>10: There are 100 billion solar systems in the Milky Way</h1>
        In ancient times, the solar system was considered to represent the entire universe and the planets were believed to be wandering stars orbiting the Earth along with the Sun and stars. With the advent of the scientific revolution beginning in 1543, the Earth was later included in the list of planets but until recently astronomers still knew of only one solar system in the universe. Within the last 17 years or so, however, over 4,000 planets orbiting distant stars have been found and scientists now estimate that there may be as many as 100 billion solar systems in our own Milky Way galaxy, alone.
